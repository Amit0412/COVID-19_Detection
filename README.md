# COVID-19
A Deep-Learning Project using CNN and transfer learning with the VGG16 model to detect COVID-19 in the person with having accuracy of 97.50% based on the x-ray of the chest of the person. <br/>
I am taking the COVID-19 datset from the public repo maitained by @ieee8023. The link to repo is https://github.com/ieee8023/covid-chestxray-dataset .
<br/>
I trained the model with a small amount of dataset as earlier the dataset was not large, but as the time will pass and the dataset will expand you can download the dataset and retain the model.
